# Light and Sound

"Light and Sound" is a little game made for CodePath's Summer Internship for Tech Excellence (SITE).
The premise of the game is simple. The player will follow the order of the buttons pressed either through seeing the lit buttons (light) or the tone of the buttons (sound).
The pattern increases in complexity for each level, until either an error is made or the player successfully repeats the entire pattern.

# Time Breakdown

- Adding basic functionality, brushing up on basic webdev HTML/CSS/JS (1 Hour)
- Adding additional functionality, such as speeding up, additional buttons, and more (TBD)

# Questions and Reflections

**1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.**

Beyond the CodePath prework guide, I also used the Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) documentation extensively as a general manual for HTML/CSS/JS material.

**2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it?**

One challenge that I encountered during the creation of this submission had to deal with (re)learning the CSS to make the website visually appealing.
As someone who usually invests a majority of a project's development time to functionality, some of the more important consumer-facing skills are underutilized. I used the CodePath
guide as a baseline, then checked out a few resources online (namely the Mozilla Developer Network documentation, which is excellent) to find my way around CSS again.

**3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission?**

As a web developer, what are the expectations for time spent on backend versus frontend? I understand that certain roles specialize on a certain part, but what about fullstack developers?
Would I be spending a majority of my time designing the website, working on HTML/CSS structuring, or the JS that powers the operation?

**4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific.**

If I had a few more hours to work on the project, I would continue to improve the user experience and add some small additional features. There are already some small easter eggs to be found though :D
